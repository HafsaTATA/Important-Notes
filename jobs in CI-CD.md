### Understanding Jobs in CI/CD

In the context of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), a "job" is a unit of work that is executed as part of the automation pipeline. CI/CD pipelines typically consist of multiple jobs that handle different stages of the process, such as building, testing, and deploying code.

#### Key Concepts of Jobs in CI/CD:

1. **Modularization**: Jobs allow you to break down the CI/CD pipeline into modular, manageable units. Each job performs a specific task or set of tasks.
2. **Isolation**: Jobs run in isolation, meaning the environment and dependencies for one job do not affect another.
3. **Dependencies**: Jobs can have dependencies, meaning one job can depend on the successful completion of another before it starts.
4. **Parallelism**: Multiple jobs can run in parallel, speeding up the overall CI/CD process.

### Common Types of Jobs in CI/CD Pipelines:

1. **Build Job**:
   - Purpose: To compile or build the code into an executable format. In the context of Docker, this job typically builds Docker images.
   - Actions: Compiling source code, running build scripts, creating Docker images, etc.
   - Example: Building a Docker image from a `Dockerfile`.

2. **Test Job**:
   - Purpose: To run automated tests to verify that the code works as expected.
   - Actions: Running unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, etc.
   - Example: Using tools like JUnit for Java applications to run tests.

3. **Deploy Job**:
   - Purpose: To deploy the built and tested code to a production or staging environment.
   - Actions: Pushing Docker images to a container registry, deploying applications to servers or cloud services, updating Kubernetes clusters, etc.
   - Example: Deploying a Docker container to an AWS EC2 instance or a Kubernetes cluster.

### Example: Build and Deploy Jobs

#### Build Job

A build job typically involves compiling the code, creating Docker images, and pushing those images to a Docker registry (e.g., Amazon ECR).

**Steps in a Build Job:**
- Checkout the code from the repository.
- Set up the necessary build environment (e.g., JDK, Node.js).
- Run build commands to compile the code and create Docker images.
- Push the Docker images to a container registry.

#### Deploy Job

A deploy job involves taking the built Docker images and deploying them to a production or staging environment.

**Steps in a Deploy Job:**
- Pull the Docker images from the container registry.
- Stop and remove the existing containers.
- Run new containers with the updated images.

### Example Workflow with Build and Deploy Jobs

Here's an example `deploy.yml` that demonstrates the separation of build and deploy jobs:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

permissions:
  id-token: write  # Required for requesting the JWT
  contents: read  # Required for actions/checkout

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]  # Trigger on push to the main branch
    paths:
      - 'src/**'  # Update to your new backend source path
      - '.github/workflows/deploy.yml'  # Trigger if the workflow file itself is changed

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        ref: ${{ github.ref }}
    
    - name: Set up JDK 21
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '21'
        distribution: 'temurin'
        cache: maven
    
    - name: Run tests with Maven
      run: mvn -B verify -Dmaven.test.skip=false --file pom.xml

    - name: Configure AWS Credentials 
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v3
      with:
        audience: sts.amazonaws.com
        aws-region: us-east-2
        role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::687456531778:role/github_actions

    - name: Login to Amazon ECR
      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v2
      id: login-ecr
    
    - name: echo registry
      run: echo ${{ steps.login-ecr.outputs.registry }}

    - name: Build, tag, and push docker image to Amazon ECR
      env:
        REGISTRY: ${{ steps.login-ecr.outputs.registry }}
        REPOSITORY: islam-center
        IMAGE_TAG: latest
      run: |
        docker build -f "dockerfile.yml" -t $REGISTRY/$REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG .
        docker push $REGISTRY/$REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build  # Ensure the deploy job runs after the build job
    steps:
    - name: Pull docker image on the server and run it
      uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.3
      with:
        host: ${{ secrets.PROD_HOST }}
        username: ${{ secrets.PROD_USER }}
        key: ${{ secrets.TESTPROD_SSH_KEY }}
        script: |
            aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID }}.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
            docker pull ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID }}.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/islam-center:latest
            docker container stop api
            docker container rm api
            docker run -d -p 8085:8085 -v /var/islamcenters:/var/islamcenters \
            --env-file /var/islamcenters/.env_api \
            --name api ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID }}.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/islam-center:latest
```

### Explanation

1. **Build Job**:
   - **Checkout Code**: Pulls the code from the GitHub repository.
   - **Set up JDK 21**: Prepares the Java environment.
   - **Run tests with Maven**: Executes the tests to ensure code quality.
   - **Configure AWS Credentials**: Sets up AWS credentials for subsequent steps.
   - **Login to Amazon ECR**: Logs in to the Amazon ECR registry.
   - **Build, tag, and push docker image to Amazon ECR**: Builds the Docker image and pushes it to the ECR registry.

2. **Deploy Job**:
   - **Dependencies**: The deploy job depends on the build job (`needs: build`), ensuring it runs only after the build job completes successfully.
   - **SSH Action**: Uses the `appleboy/ssh-action` to connect to the EC2 instance and execute deployment commands.
   - **Docker Commands**: Pulls the Docker image, stops and removes the existing container, and runs the new container.

### Summary

- **Jobs in CI/CD**: Units of work that handle specific stages like building, testing, and deploying code.
- **Build Job**: Compiles code, runs tests, builds Docker images, and pushes them to a registry.
- **Deploy Job**: Pulls the Docker images and deploys them to the production environment.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each job has a clear responsibility, making the CI/CD pipeline more organized and maintainable.

By separating build and deploy jobs, you can better manage and debug your CI/CD pipeline, ensuring a smooth deployment process. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
