# Review abt the different dockerfiles in back and front:
### Analysis of Dockerfiles

Let's review your Dockerfiles and answer your questions.

#### Frontend Dockerfiles

**1. `dockerfile.yml`:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:21-alpine3.19 as base
RUN apk add --no-cache g++ make py3-pip libc6-compat
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
EXPOSE 3000

FROM base as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM base as production
WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1
RUN npm ci

RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
USER nextjs

COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public

CMD npm start
```
- **Base Stage**: Sets up a base image with Node.js and necessary build tools.
- **Builder Stage**: Builds the application.
- **Production Stage**: Prepares the production environment with necessary configurations.

**2. `dockerfile.yml.dev`:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:21

WORKDIR /app
COPY Islamic_Center_Frontend/package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY Islamic_Center_Frontend/ .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD npm run dev
```
- **Development Stage**: Installs dependencies and starts the development server.

**3. `dockerfile.yml.prod`:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:21

WORKDIR /app
COPY Islamic_Center_Frontend/package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY Islamic_Center_Frontend/. .
ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1
ARG STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
ENV STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=$STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000

CMD npm start
```
- **Production Stage**: Installs dependencies, builds the application, and starts the production server.

#### Backend Dockerfile

**1. `dockerfile.yml`:**
```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine as build
WORKDIR /workspace/app

COPY Islamic_Center_Backend/mvnw .
COPY Islamic_Center_Backend/.mvn .mvn
COPY Islamic_Center_Backend/pom.xml .
COPY Islamic_Center_Backend/src src

RUN chmod +x mvnw 
RUN ./mvnw install -DskipTests=true -Pprod
RUN mkdir -p target/dependency && (cd target/dependency; jar -xf ../*.jar)

FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine
VOLUME /tmp
ARG DEPENDENCY=/workspace/app/target/dependency
COPY --from=build ${DEPENDENCY}/BOOT-INF/lib /app/lib
COPY --from=build ${DEPENDENCY}/META-INF /app/META-INF
COPY --from=build ${DEPENDENCY}/BOOT-INF/classes /app
EXPOSE 8085
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-cp","app:app/lib/*","com.gerberlabs.islamiccenter.IslamicCentersBackendApplication"]
```
- **Build Stage**: Builds the Java application using Maven.
- **Final Stage**: Copies the built application and dependencies into a new image and sets up the entry point.

### Questions Answered

**1. Do I have to create `dockerfile.yml.dev` and `dockerfile.yml.prod` for the backend too or is the one mentioned enough?**

**Answer**: The current `dockerfile.yml` for the backend is sufficient for building a production image. However, if you need to run the backend in a development environment with specific configurations (like hot-reloading, development dependencies, etc.), it might be useful to create `dockerfile.yml.dev`. Similarly, you could create `dockerfile.yml.prod` to explicitly define the production setup, although your existing `dockerfile.yml` already serves that purpose.

**Example `dockerfile.yml.dev` for Backend:**
```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk-alpine

WORKDIR /workspace/app

COPY Islamic_Center_Backend/mvnw .
COPY Islamic_Center_Backend/.mvn .mvn
COPY Islamic_Center_Backend/pom.xml .
COPY Islamic_Center_Backend/src src

RUN chmod +x mvnw 
RUN ./mvnw install

EXPOSE 8085
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/workspace/app/target/your-app.jar"]
```
- This example assumes that you are running your app with a development profile and potentially with hot-reloading if applicable.

**2. Are these Dockerfiles enough so I can move to the next step of identifying my YAML workflow files for CI/CD?**

**Answer**: Yes, these Dockerfiles are sufficient to build the entire app image. The provided Dockerfiles for the frontend and backend should work well with your CI/CD pipelines. 

### Plan to Complete the Project

1. **Verify Dockerfiles**:
   - Ensure the Dockerfiles build and run correctly by manually building and running the images locally.
   - For frontend: `docker build -f dockerfile.yml -t frontend:latest .`
   - For backend: `docker build -f dockerfile.yml -t backend:latest .`

2. **Set Up CI/CD Workflows**:
   - Use the provided Dockerfiles in your GitHub Actions workflows.
   - Ensure you have separate jobs for building and pushing frontend and backend images to AWS ECR.

3. **Testing**:
   - Create a feature branch, push your changes, and create a pull request.
   - Check the GitHub Actions tab for workflow runs and verify that the images are built and deployed correctly.

4. **Deploy to AWS**:
   - Ensure your AWS credentials and secrets are properly configured in GitHub.
   - Verify that the applications are running correctly on the AWS infrastructure.

5. **Monitor and Iterate**:
   - Monitor the deployment, address any issues, and make iterative improvements to your Dockerfiles and workflows.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Dockerfiles and CI/CD workflows are correctly set up to build and deploy your application. If you have further questions or need more detailed steps, feel free to ask!

# But in the frontend i have 3 dockerfiles so why building only one?

Given that you have three Dockerfiles for different environments (development, production, and a base Dockerfile), you'll want to build images specific to each environment. Each Dockerfile serves a different purpose, and you'll typically build each one depending on the context in which you're deploying or developing.

### Building All Dockerfiles

You can build images from each Dockerfile using appropriate tags to distinguish them.

#### 1. Building the Base Dockerfile (`dockerfile.yml`)

This Dockerfile appears to be a base setup that builds the production image using a multi-stage build:

```sh
docker build -f dockerfile.yml -t frontend:base .
```

#### 2. Building the Development Dockerfile (`dockerfile.yml.dev`)

This Dockerfile is for development purposes:

```sh
docker build -f dockerfile.yml.dev -t frontend:dev .
```

#### 3. Building the Production Dockerfile (`dockerfile.yml.prod`)

This Dockerfile is for production purposes:

```sh
docker build -f dockerfile.yml.prod -t frontend:prod .
```

### Full Workflow with Different Environments

1. **Base Build**:
   ```sh
   docker build -f dockerfile.yml -t frontend:base .
   ```

2. **Development Build**:
   ```sh
   docker build -f dockerfile.yml.dev -t frontend:dev .
   ```

3. **Production Build**:
   ```sh
   docker build -f dockerfile.yml.prod -t frontend:prod .
   ```

### Explanation of Commands

- `docker build`: The command to build Docker images.
- `-f dockerfile.yml`: Specifies the Dockerfile to use.
- `-t frontend:base`: Tags the image with the name `frontend` and tag `base`.
- `.`: The current directory as the build context.

### Integrating with CI/CD

You can integrate these builds into your CI/CD pipeline as separate jobs. Here's an example of how you might set up your GitHub Actions workflow for different environments:

#### GitHub Actions Workflow Example

```yaml
name: Frontend CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - 'Islamic_Center_Frontend/**'
      - '.github/workflows/frontend.yml'
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-base:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build Base Image
      run: docker build -f dockerfile.yml -t frontend:base .

  build-dev:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build Development Image
      run: docker build -f dockerfile.yml.dev -t frontend:dev .

  build-prod:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build Production Image
      run: docker build -f dockerfile.yml.prod -t frontend:prod .

  deploy-prod:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build-prod
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Configure AWS Credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v3
      with:
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        aws-region: us-east-2
    - name: Login to Amazon ECR
      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1
    - name: Build, tag, and push docker image to Amazon ECR
      env:
        REGISTRY: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY }}
        REPOSITORY: islam-center-frontend
        IMAGE_TAG: latest
      run: |
        docker build -f dockerfile.yml.prod -t $REGISTRY/$REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG .
        docker push $REGISTRY/$REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG
    - name: Deploy to ECS
      run: |
        aws ecs update-service --cluster my-cluster --service my-service --force-new-deployment
```

### Summary

Each Dockerfile has its purpose:

- `dockerfile.yml`: Base build, useful for shared configurations.
- `dockerfile.yml.dev`: Development-specific build.
- `dockerfile.yml.prod`: Production-specific build.

You should build and tag each image appropriately and integrate these steps into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure the correct images are used in the correct environments.
