# what is docker multi-stages?
Docker multi-stage builds are a way to use multiple `FROM` statements in your Dockerfile, each creating a different stage of the build. This technique allows you to separate the build environment from the runtime environment, significantly reducing the size of the final Docker image. By leveraging multi-stage builds, you can keep your images lean and efficient while maintaining a clean and modular Dockerfile.

### **Benefits of Multi-Stage Builds**

1. **Reduced Image Size**: Only the necessary artifacts are copied to the final image, discarding the build dependencies and intermediate files.
2. **Improved Security**: The final image does not contain any build tools or dependencies that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities.
3. **Better Organization**: The Dockerfile is more organized, separating the build steps from the final runtime configuration.

### **How Multi-Stage Builds Work**

In a multi-stage build, you can define multiple stages in your Dockerfile using multiple `FROM` statements. Each `FROM` statement starts a new stage, and you can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another.

### **Example of a Multi-Stage Dockerfile**

Let's take a look at an example Dockerfile for a Node.js application using multi-stage builds. This Dockerfile includes stages for building the application and preparing the production environment.

#### **Multi-Stage Dockerfile Example**

```dockerfile
# Base image for building the application
FROM node:21-alpine3.19 as base
RUN apk add --no-cache g++ make py3-pip libc6-compat

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Stage for building the application
FROM base as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Final stage for production
FROM node:21-alpine3.19 as production
WORKDIR /app

# Environment variables
ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

# Install only production dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci

# Add user
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
USER nextjs

# Copy built files and other necessary files from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the application
CMD npm start
```

### **Explanation of the Dockerfile**

1. **Base Image Stage**:
   - `FROM node:21-alpine3.19 as base`: This is the base stage, where you install all the dependencies required for building the application.
   - `RUN apk add --no-cache g++ make py3-pip libc6-compat`: Installs necessary build tools.
   - `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory.
   - `COPY package*.json ./`: Copies the package.json and package-lock.json files to the container.
   - `RUN npm install`: Installs all Node.js dependencies.

2. **Builder Stage**:
   - `FROM base as builder`: Uses the base stage to create a new stage called `builder`.
   - `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory.
   - `COPY . .`: Copies the entire application source code to the container.
   - `RUN npm run build`: Builds the application.

3. **Production Stage**:
   - `FROM node:21-alpine3.19 as production`: Creates the final production stage, starting with a clean Node.js image.
   - `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory.
   - `ENV NODE_ENV=production`: Sets the environment variable for production.
   - `ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1`: Disables Next.js telemetry.
   - `COPY package*.json ./`: Copies the package.json and package-lock.json files.
   - `RUN npm ci`: Installs only production dependencies.
   - `RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs` and `RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001`: Adds a non-root user for running the application.
   - `USER nextjs`: Switches to the non-root user.
   - `COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next ./.next`: Copies the built application files from the builder stage.
   - `COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules`: Copies the node_modules directory from the builder stage.
   - `COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json`: Copies the package.json file from the builder stage.
   - `COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public`: Copies the public directory from the builder stage.
   - `EXPOSE 3000`: Exposes port 3000.
   - `CMD npm start`: Starts the application.

### **Building and Running the Docker Image**

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-application:latest .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 your-application:latest
   ```

### **Using Docker Compose with Multi-Stage Builds**

You can use Docker Compose to manage different environments (development, production) and leverage multi-stage builds.

#### **Example `docker-compose.yml` for Production**

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  cms:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      target: production
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: production
      NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED: 1
      STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: ${STRIPE_SECRET_KEY}  # Ensure this is set in your environment
    command: npm start
```

### **Summary**

- **Multi-Stage Builds**: Use multiple `FROM` statements to create separate stages for building and running your application, optimizing the final image size and security.
- **Docker Compose**: Manage different environments and configurations using Docker Compose with multi-stage builds.

This approach keeps your Docker setup efficient, secure, and easy to manage. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ”§

# does my cms project usse teh docker multi-stages?
Yes, your CMS project does utilize Docker multi-stage builds. Let's break down how your `dockerfile.yml` makes use of this feature and compare it to the single Dockerfiles you have for development and production.

### **Dockerfile with Multi-Stage Builds**

#### **Your `dockerfile.yml`**

Here is your `dockerfile.yml` which uses multi-stage builds:

```dockerfile
# Base image
FROM node:21-alpine3.19 as base
RUN apk add --no-cache g++ make py3-pip libc6-compat
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
EXPOSE 3000

# Builder stage
FROM base as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM base as production
WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1
RUN npm ci

RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
USER nextjs

COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public

CMD npm start
```

### **Understanding Multi-Stage Builds in Your Dockerfile**

**1. Base Stage**:
- `FROM node:21-alpine3.19 as base`: This stage sets up a base image with Node.js and necessary build tools.
- `RUN apk add --no-cache g++ make py3-pip libc6-compat`: Installs additional tools required for building Node.js modules.
- `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory to `/app`.
- `COPY package*.json ./`: Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to the working directory.
- `EXPOSE 3000`: Exposes port 3000, which is typically used by Node.js applications.

**2. Builder Stage**:
- `FROM base as builder`: Uses the `base` stage to start a new build stage named `builder`.
- `WORKDIR /app`: Ensures the working directory is `/app`.
- `COPY . .`: Copies the entire project to the container.
- `RUN npm run build`: Runs the build command to compile the application.

**3. Production Stage**:
- `FROM base as production`: Starts a new stage from the `base` image for the production environment.
- `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory to `/app`.
- `ENV NODE_ENV=production`: Sets the Node environment to production.
- `ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1`: Disables Next.js telemetry.
- `RUN npm ci`: Installs production dependencies.
- `RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs` and `RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001`: Adds a non-root user for security.
- `USER nextjs`: Switches to the non-root user.
- `COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next ./.next`: Copies the build artifacts from the `builder` stage.
- `COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules`: Copies the node modules from the `builder` stage.
- `COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json`: Copies the `package.json` from the `builder` stage.
- `COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public`: Copies the `public` directory from the `builder` stage.
- `CMD npm start`: Starts the application.

### **Comparison with Single-Stage Dockerfiles**

#### **Single-Stage Dockerfile for Development (`dockerfile.yml.dev`)**

```dockerfile
FROM node:21

WORKDIR /app
COPY Islamic_Center_Frontend/package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY Islamic_Center_Frontend/ .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD npm run dev
```

- **Purpose**: Sets up a development environment with hot-reloading (`npm run dev`).
- **No Separation of Concerns**: Everything happens in a single stage. This is typical for development where you want to iterate quickly and donâ€™t need to optimize for size or security.

#### **Single-Stage Dockerfile for Production (`dockerfile.yml.prod`)**

```dockerfile
FROM node:21

WORKDIR /app
COPY Islamic_Center_Frontend/package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY Islamic_Center_Frontend/ .
ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1
ARG STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
ENV STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=$STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD npm start
```

- **Purpose**: Sets up a production environment.
- **No Separation of Build and Runtime**: This Dockerfile installs dependencies, builds the application, and serves it all in one stage, which can lead to larger image sizes and potential security issues as it includes build tools in the final image.

### **Advantages of Multi-Stage Builds**

- **Size Optimization**: The final image only includes the runtime dependencies, significantly reducing the image size.
- **Security**: By excluding build tools and intermediate files from the final image, you reduce the attack surface.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly separates the build environment from the runtime environment.

### **Deployment Process for CMS Project**

Given the multi-stage Dockerfile (`dockerfile.yml`), you can streamline your deployment process using Docker Compose.

#### **Example `docker-compose.yml` for Production**

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  cms:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: dockerfile.yml
      target: production
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: production
      NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED: 1
      STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: ${STRIPE_SECRET_KEY}  # Ensure this is set in your environment
    command: npm start
```

### **Steps to Deploy**

1. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create an `.env` file to store environment-specific variables (e.g., `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`).

2. **Build and Run for Production**:
   - Use the production Docker Compose file.

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
   ```

### **Summary**

- **Multi-Stage Builds**: Your `dockerfile.yml` uses multi-stage builds to optimize the final Docker image by separating the build environment from the runtime environment.
- **Single-Stage Builds**: Your development and production Dockerfiles (`dockerfile.yml.dev` and `dockerfile.yml.prod`) use single-stage builds, which are simpler but less optimized.
- **Docker Compose**: Use Docker Compose to manage environment-specific configurations and build processes efficiently.

This approach keeps your Docker setup efficient, secure, and easy to manage. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ”§
