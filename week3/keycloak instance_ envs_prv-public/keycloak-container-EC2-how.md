Yes, you are correct. Keycloak should be running inside the Docker container, not directly on the EC2 instance. Here’s a breakdown of the setup:

### Environment Setup Recap
1. **EC2 Instance**: This is your virtual machine running on AWS. It hosts the Docker runtime which allows you to run containers.
2. **Docker**: This is the containerization platform installed on your EC2 instance. It enables you to run applications in isolated environments called containers.
3. **Keycloak Docker Container**: This is the container running on your EC2 instance. It contains Keycloak and its dependencies, isolated from the rest of the EC2 instance.

!!EC2 is your VMs
!!Docker is a piece of software you install on your VMs to run containers

### Key Points
- **Keycloak Installation**: Keycloak is installed and runs within the Docker container. It is not installed directly on the EC2 instance’s filesystem.
- **Certificates**: Your Let's Encrypt certificates are mounted into the container from the EC2 instance. This allows Keycloak to use these certificates for HTTPS without having them directly in the container image.
- **Environment Variables**: These are set to configure Keycloak within the container. They are not set on the EC2 instance itself but passed to the container at runtime.
- **Networking**: Ports 80 and 443 on the EC2 instance are mapped to the respective ports in the Keycloak container. This setup allows external access to Keycloak through the EC2 instance’s public IP or domain name.

### Verification
To ensure everything is set up correctly, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check Running Containers**:
    ```bash
    sudo docker ps
    ```
    This command should show the Keycloak container running with the specified port mappings.

2. **Access Keycloak**:
    Open your browser and navigate to `https://auth.geberlabs.com`. Ensure you can reach the Keycloak login page.

3. **Inspect Logs**:
    Check the container logs for any errors or confirmation that Keycloak started successfully:
    ```bash
    sudo docker logs mynewkeycloak
    ```

### Summary
- **EC2 Instance**: Hosts Docker, does not directly run Keycloak.
- **Docker**: Runs the Keycloak container.
- **Keycloak Container**: Runs Keycloak and uses the mounted certificates for HTTPS.
- **Environment Configuration**: Passed to the container at runtime to ensure Keycloak is configured correctly.

Your setup appears to be correct if Keycloak is accessible via the domain and operates as expected. If you encounter any issues, reviewing the Docker container logs and configurations will help diagnose and resolve them.
