### Review of Storage Choices

Your current storage choices are mostly correct, but let's review them to ensure they align with your needs and remain within the free tier or minimal cost.

### Detailed Review

1. **Volume Size: 30 GiB**
   - **Comment:** This size is within the free tier limit, which provides up to 30 GiB of free storage per month on General Purpose (gp3) volumes. This choice is correct.

2. **Volume Type: gp3**
   - **Comment:** General Purpose SSD (gp3) is a good choice for balance between performance and cost. This is also within the free tier limit. This choice is correct.

3. **IOPS: 3000**
   - **Comment:** The free tier does not include a specific IOPS limit, but gp3 volumes come with baseline performance. The default gp3 volume comes with 3000 IOPS included without additional cost. If you request higher IOPS, it may incur additional charges.
   - **Recommendation:** Keep the default 3000 IOPS to avoid additional charges. If performance requirements are higher, review the cost implications.

4. **Throughput: 125 MiB/s**
   - **Comment:** The throughput of 125 MiB/s is within the standard provisioned for gp3 volumes. There is no additional cost for this setting unless you specify a higher throughput than the default.

5. **Delete on Termination: Yes**
   - **Comment:** This setting is correct as it ensures the volume will be deleted when the instance is terminated, avoiding unnecessary storage costs.

6. **Encryption: Enabled**
   - **Comment:** Encryption is a good practice for security, especially for instances handling sensitive data. AWS does not charge extra for using EBS encryption, so this is a good choice.

7. **KMS Key: Default**
   - **Comment:** If you do not select a specific KMS key, AWS will use the default key for EBS encryption, which is free to use. If you use a customer-managed key (CMK), there may be additional costs associated with the key management.

### Summary of Free Tier Eligibility and Cost Implications

- **Volume Size:** 30 GiB - Within free tier.
- **Volume Type:** gp3 - Within free tier.
- **IOPS:** 3000 - Default for gp3, no additional cost if not increased.
- **Throughput:** 125 MiB/s - Default for gp3, no additional cost if not increased.
- **Delete on Termination:** Yes - Correct choice to avoid unnecessary costs.
- **Encryption:** Enabled - No additional cost.
- **KMS Key:** Default - No additional cost if the default key is used.

### Recommendations

- **Ensure that IOPS and Throughput are kept at default levels unless higher performance is required and budget allows.**
- **Review the AWS Pricing Calculator for EBS to confirm costs if you need to increase IOPS or throughput.**

Your current choices seem to be within the free tier limits, and you have configured encryption correctly for security purposes. If you keep the default IOPS and throughput, there should be no additional costs beyond the free tier for storage.
