A `docker-compose.yml` file is used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. If your backend repo was successfully built and deployed without a `docker-compose.yml` file, it means that your deployment setup is handling the Docker container lifecycle without the need for Docker Compose.

### How Your Deployment Works Without Docker Compose

1. **Single Container Application**: If your application consists of a single container, Docker Compose is not strictly necessary. You can build and run the container directly using Docker commands, which is what your GitHub Actions workflow is doing.

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Your CI/CD pipeline defined in GitHub Actions takes care of building the Docker image, pushing it to Amazon ECR, and then deploying it to an EC2 instance. Here’s how it works:

    - **Building the Docker Image**:
      ```yaml
      - name: Build, tag, and push docker image to Amazon ECR
        env:
          REGISTRY: ${{ steps.login-ecr.outputs.registry }}
          REPOSITORY: islam-center
          IMAGE_TAG: latest
        run: |
          docker build -f "dockerfile.yml" -t $REGISTRY/$REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG .
          docker push $REGISTRY/$REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG
      ```

    - **Deploying the Docker Container**:
      ```yaml
      - name: Pull docker image on the server and run it
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.3
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.PROD_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.PROD_USER }}
          key: ${{ secrets.TESTPROD_SSH_KEY }}
          script: |
              aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 687456531778.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
              docker pull 687456531778.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/islam-center:latest
              docker container stop api
              docker container rm api
              docker run -d -p 8085:8085 -v /var/islamcenters:/var/islamcenters \
              --env-file /var/islamcenters/.env_api \
              --name api 687456531778.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/islam-center:latest
      ```

### When to Use Docker Compose

You might want to use Docker Compose if:

1. **Multiple Containers**: Your application consists of multiple services that need to be orchestrated together, such as a backend API, a database, and a frontend service.
2. **Simplified Management**: You want to simplify the management of multi-container applications, making it easier to start, stop, and manage the lifecycle of the application.
3. **Development Environment**: You need a consistent environment for local development that mimics the production setup.

### Example `docker-compose.yml`

If you decide to add a `docker-compose.yml` file, here’s a simple example for a single service:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  api:
    image: 687456531778.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/islam-center:latest
    ports:
      - "8085:8085"
    volumes:
      - /var/islamcenters:/var/islamcenters
    env_file:
      - /var/islamcenters/.env_api
```

### Adding Docker Compose to Your Workflow

If you want to include Docker Compose in your GitHub Actions workflow, you can modify the script section to use `docker-compose` commands. Here’s an example snippet:

```yaml
- name: Deploy using Docker Compose
  uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.3
  with:
    host: ${{ secrets.PROD_HOST }}
    username: ${{ secrets.PROD_USER }}
    key: ${{ secrets.TESTPROD_SSH_KEY }}
    script: |
      aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 687456531778.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
      docker pull 687456531778.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/islam-center:latest
      cd /path/to/your/docker-compose
      docker-compose down
      docker-compose up -d
```

### Conclusion

Your deployment was successful without a `docker-compose.yml` file because the current setup handles the Docker commands directly. If you need to manage multiple services or prefer the simplified syntax of Docker Compose, you can add a `docker-compose.yml` file to your project and adjust your workflows accordingly.
